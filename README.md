# Imaris-Data-Organizer
Simple MatLab script to organize data generated by Bitplane Imaris

This is a simple script I wrote in MatLab to process and sort data generated by the commercial microscopy analysis software, Bitplane Imaris. This script allows the user to specify a parameter, reads and extracts that parameter from chosen Excel files, and pools that data into a single file organized by file/experiment. This script cuts down on the time needed to process Imaris data by removing the need to manually handle multiple Excel files.
